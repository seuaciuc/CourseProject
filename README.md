# General Info

Project material is structured in 3 folders:
- *Data*: contains all data, both raw and processed. Smaller sub-samples of the datasets are provided.
- *Models*: contains all models (pickle files with estimated model paramters). 
- *Codes*: all scripts are here.

Each folder contains a README.md with specific information about their contents and structure.
All code is done in Python. Data (information from one step to another) is shared through pickle files, so typically the codes take one file as input and generate others as output. Codes are set to the folder structure of this repository, so it needs to be maintained to be able to run the scripts without modification.
