## Data Processing Scripts
The scripts below were used to process the raw review data.
They are set to run on the full dataset, which takes a while and generates files larger than GitHub allows me.
A smaller sub-sample of the datasets is provided to test the codes on, if desired. The scripts are set to run on those.
- *processHOTELreviews.py*:
  - Processes the hotel reviews.
- processMP3reviews.py:
  - Processes the MP3 reviews.
- processMP3reviews_split.py:
  - Processes the MP3 reviews after separating them in low (3 or lower) and high (above 3) ratings.
